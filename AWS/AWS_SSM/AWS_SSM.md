# Step 17: Create EC2Messages Endpoint

Create another endpoint.

Service:

```text
com.amazonaws.ap-south-1.ec2messages
```

Purpose:

Acts as a communication channel between the SSM Agent and AWS.

Think of it as a mailbox service.

Use Cases:

- Agent polling
- Command delivery
- Command acknowledgements
- Status reporting

Use same configuration.

Create Endpoint.

Wait for:

```text
Available
```

# Step 18: Connect Using Session Manager

Expected:

```bash
sh-5.2$
```

or

```bash
ec2-user@ip-10-0-2-x
```

---

# Verification Commands

Check current user:

```bash
whoami
```

Check hostname:

```bash
hostname
```

Check IP address:

```bash
ip addr
```

Check IAM Role access:

```bash
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

---

# Expected Outcome

You have successfully:

* Created a custom VPC
* Created Public and Private Subnets
* Configured Route Tables
* Attached Internet Gateway
* Created Security Groups
* Created IAM Role
* Attached AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore Policy
* Launched Private EC2
* Created 3 VPC Interface Endpoints
* Registered EC2 with Systems Manager
* Connected to Private EC2 without SSH
* Connected without Public IP
* Connected without Bastion Host

---

# Cleanup

Delete resources in the following order:

1. Terminate EC2 Instance
2. Delete VPC Endpoints
3. Delete Security Groups
4. Delete Route Tables
5. Detach and Delete Internet Gateway
6. Delete Subnets
7. Delete VPC
8. Delete IAM Role (Optional)

This avoids unnecessary AWS charges.
